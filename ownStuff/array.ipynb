    "| Operation               | Array/List | String(Immutable)  | Useful Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

    "| Appending to the end    | O(1)       | O(n)    | **Array/List:** Typically O(1) on average due to dynamic resizing. While resizing can take O(n), it happens infrequently. <br> **String:** In many programming languages, strings are immutable. Appending creates a new string, which involves copying the original string (O(n)). Some languages might have optimized string builders for more efficient appending.                                                                                                                             |\n",
    "| Popping from end        | O(1)       | O(n)    | **Array/List:** Removing the last element is generally a constant-time operation. <br> **String:** Similar to appending, removing the last character often involves creating a new string (O(n)) as strings are immutable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",
    "| Insertion, not from end | O(n)       | O(n)    | **Array/List:** Inserting at an arbitrary position requires shifting subsequent elements to make space, resulting in O(n) time complexity in the worst case (insertion at the beginning). <br> **String:** Inserting in the middle of a string usually involves creating a new string by concatenating the parts before and after the insertion, which takes O(n) time as you need to copy the existing characters.                                                                              |\n",
    "| Deletion, not from end       | O(n)       | O(n)    | **Array/List:** Deleting an element at an arbitrary position requires shifting subsequent elements to fill the gap, resulting in O(n) time complexity in the worst case (deletion at the beginning). <br> **String:** Deleting from the middle of a string typically involves creating a new string by concatenating the parts before and after the deletion, taking O(n) time due to the need to copy the remaining characters.                                                                        |\n",
    "| Random Access           | O(1)       | O(1)    | **Array/List:** Arrays and Lists provide direct access to elements based on their index. This is a constant-time operation because the memory location of any element can be calculated directly from the starting address and the index. <br> **String:** Strings also allow direct access to individual characters by their index, similar to arrays, making it an O(1) operation.                                                                                                                   |\n",
    "| Check if element exist  | O(n)       | O(n)    | **Array/List:** To check if a specific element exists, you typically need to iterate through the array or list, comparing each element until you find a match or reach the end. In the worst case, you might need to check all n elements. <br> **String:** To check if a specific character or substring exists, you might need to iterate through the string or use string searching algorithms. In the simplest case of checking for a single character, it might involve iterating through the string in the worst case. |"
